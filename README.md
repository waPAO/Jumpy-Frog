# :frog: Jumpy-Frog :frog:
A unity web game inspired by the original Flappy Bird!

As a kid, Flappy Bird was the first ios game that really grabbed my time and attention. I would spend countless hours playing the game and trying to 
reach new high scores. For my first Unity project, it only made sense to go back to my roots and try to recreate the game. 
My version though, is all about Froggy the Frog as he tries to traverse through the course!

## Main Unity Components
* Scenes
* Sprites
* Physics 2D Rendering
* Rigid Body 2D
* Circle Collider 2D
* Audio Source
* TextMeshPro
* EventSystem
* Logic Manager
* Custom Game C# Scripts
* PlayerPrefs 
* Local Storage

### How to Play
Just like, the original Flappy Bird, Jumpy Frog is no different where there is only one main mechanic. Although, instead of tapping the screen,
this web-based game will be played with the space bar

### Where to Play
My first version of the game can be located on Unity Play.
